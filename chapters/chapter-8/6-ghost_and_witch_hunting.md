# Ghost and witch hunting

>“Every organization has its ghosts — outdated processes, forgotten applications, and rules that no longer serve their purpose. Left unchecked, these specters haunt employees and customers, draining energy and creativity. True digital transformation begins by hunting these ghosts, exposing inefficiencies, dismantling silos, and reclaiming hidden value buried inside the organization.”

>In the movie “Ghostbusters”, Peter, Raymond and Egon are university professors of parapsychology and metallurgy. They were primed and ready with their innovation, a proton backpack that captures ectoplasm, a trap for trapping and transporting ghosts, and a storage receiver. When businesses discovered they were infested with ghosts, and saw that this scared the customers, The Ghostbusters grew their business a lot.

Over time, organizations accumulate layers of processes, applications, and rules that, instead of adding value, start acting as ghosts — invisible but draining. They consume resources, create bottlenecks, and frustrate employees and customers alike. The result? A haunted workplace where employees behave like zombies, trapped in repetitive, disconnected tasks, and customers shuffle through outdated services simply because no one dares to change them.

The metaphor may sound playful, but the impact is real. Outdated architectures, redundant applications, and siloed processes quietly erode competitiveness. Many companies, in their eagerness to innovate “from the outside in,” overlook the untapped potential within their own operations. Instead of first cleaning the house, they chase external solutions that often import more complexity than value. This is the essence of ghost and witch hunting: exposing the inefficiencies, inconsistencies, and cultural fears that haunt organizations — and exorcising them for good.

The first step is a mindset shift. Problems should not be viewed as witches to be blamed but as opportunities to learn, experiment, and improve. When organizations obsess over finding culprits, they paralyze creativity and build a culture of fear. But when they choose to look for root causes instead of scapegoats, they create a safe environment where employees feel empowered to challenge the status quo, suggest new solutions, and embrace risk without fear of punishment.

Several key practices can drive this cleansing process:

**1. Reduce Silos**

Silos emerge when departments focus narrowly on their own metrics, ignoring the broader mission. They block collaboration, slow decisions, and perpetuate inefficiencies. Breaking silos requires more than restructuring; it demands cultural alignment, shared goals, and technologies that promote transparency — from shared dashboards to collaborative platforms.

**2. Identify and Improve Processes**

Modern organizations must see processes not as rigid workflows but as living systems. Using process mining and automation tools, it is possible to uncover hidden inefficiencies, eliminate unnecessary steps, and redesign for agility. Sometimes, the best improvement is elimination: retiring a process that adds no value.

**3. Reduce Verticalization**

Excessive hierarchy is a ghost of the industrial age. When too much depends on top-down approvals, decision-making slows, innovation suffers, and employees disengage. A shift toward horizontal structures and distributed accountability creates faster, more motivated teams, with ownership of outcomes instead of mere compliance to orders.

**4. Promote Multidisciplinary and Transdisciplinary Action**

Complex problems rarely belong to a single department. Digital transformation thrives when cross-functional squads come together, blending skills and perspectives. Going further, transdisciplinary collaboration — where experts transcend their domains and co-create new approaches — accelerates innovation and nurtures resilience.

Cleaning up the organizational “attic” also reveals treasures. Hidden in legacy systems are datasets, application capabilities, and integrations that, once reorganized, can unlock new insights and efficiencies. A ghost-hunting exercise might uncover forgotten datasets that, when combined with external sources, can fuel AI-driven insights. Or redundant legacy tools that can be replaced with modern SaaS platforms or API-first solutions, reducing costs and complexity.

Most importantly, this process forces organizations to refocus: What truly creates value for customers? What is essential versus what is merely habitual? By reframing these questions, companies avoid wasting resources on rituals that no longer matter and instead concentrate on innovation, efficiency, and differentiation.

In the end, ghost and witch hunting is not about exorcising people but about cleansing outdated practices that haunt progress. Done well, it creates lighter, faster, and more adaptive organizations — where employees are energized, customers are delighted, and innovation flows naturally instead of being trapped by the ghosts of the past.
