# Making everything versus connecting everything

>“In the age of digital ecosystems, strength no longer comes from doing everything alone, but from knowing what to do—and what to connect. Great organizations thrive not by building all capabilities internally, but by orchestrating relationships that multiply value. The future belongs to those who can see the bigger map, identify the right partners, and connect the dots that matter most for customers.”

|Your core business in the ecosystem, focus on what you are good at|

>In the movie “Arrival”, Louise Banks is a renowned linguist hired to learn and interact with the language of extraterrestrials. Amidst the uncertainties, fears and insecurities of the population and the military who wish to attack extraterrestrial ships, her specialty will save the world.

This analogy applies directly to today’s business environment. The modern economy is no longer defined by vertical empires that attempt to master every step of the value chain internally. Instead, it is shaped by ecosystems—dynamic networks of organizations, partners, suppliers, customers, even competitors—that exchange value, knowledge, and innovation in fluid and adaptive ways.

For decades, many companies operated under the illusion that size and self-sufficiency were synonymous with power. They invested heavily in developing every capability in-house, from technology platforms to logistics to customer service. But as the digital landscape grew exponentially more complex, this strategy became unsustainable. No single organization can be world-class in everything. Attempting to “make everything” drains focus, slows innovation, and diverts resources from the very core activities that give an organization its unique competitive edge.

Instead, forward-looking companies are adopting a different playbook: connect everything. By strategically partnering with others—startups, niche players, technology providers, universities, and even open-source communities—they extend their capabilities far beyond what they could build alone. This model frees them to focus on their core purpose, while drawing strength from a network of collaborators who add complementary expertise and agility.

Consider Apple’s ecosystem strategy. In 2008, when it launched the App Store, Apple could have chosen to develop every application itself. It had the resources and talent. Yet it chose differently. It opened its platform to external developers, allowing thousands of other companies and individuals to create apps, tools, and services that enriched the iPhone experience. The result was not only explosive innovation but also massive customer loyalty, built on the value of a thriving ecosystem. Apple became the orchestrator, not the sole creator.

The lesson is clear: ecosystem orchestration creates multiplier effects. When companies align their core strengths with the right partners, they spark virtuous cycles where innovation, value, and trust expand for everyone involved. This orchestration requires vision: leaders must map their ecosystems, understand the roles different actors play, and identify which role their own organization can play most effectively. Some companies become orchestrators, designing the platforms and frameworks that others plug into. Others position themselves as specialists, delivering world-class capabilities within larger systems. Both roles are essential, and both create value when played consciously.

Examples abound beyond tech. In Brazil, the growth of premium and craft beer didn’t just elevate breweries—it catalyzed an entire ecosystem of suppliers, microbreweries, schools, festivals, tourism routes, and retail innovations. Each participant contributed something unique, but together they expanded the market and created a cultural movement.

Digital transformation accelerates this dynamic. Cloud services, APIs, SaaS, and blockchain-based platforms make it easier than ever to connect capabilities across organizational boundaries. The most innovative leaders today act less like empire-builders and more like connectors of value—people who can see the hidden patterns, align diverse players, and weave ecosystems where customers experience seamless, enriched journeys.

Ultimately, the question organizations must ask themselves is deceptively simple: Do we need to make everything, or should we connect everything? In most cases, the answer lies in focusing relentlessly on the core, while cultivating partnerships and orchestrating ecosystems that multiply impact.

The modern leader, like the linguist in Arrival, is one who can decipher complexity, bridge divides, and bring order to chaos by connecting the dots that matter most—for the customer, the business, and the ecosystem as a whole.
