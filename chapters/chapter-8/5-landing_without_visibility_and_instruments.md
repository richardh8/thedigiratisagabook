# Landing without visibility and instruments

>“Making decisions without reliable data is like landing a plane in the dark without instruments — possible only by luck, but rarely repeatable. In a digital world, organizations cannot rely on intuition alone; they must cultivate data as a trusted compass, ensuring a single source of truth that allows faster, safer, and smarter decisions.”

|Challenging the Status Quo for Data-Driven Leadership|

>In the movie “Sully: Miracle on the Hudson”, Captain Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger is an experienced pilot for US Airways, captaining Flight 1549 from LaGuardia New York to Charlotte. Three minutes after takeoff, both turbines are hit by birds at an altitude of 850 meters. He receives the tower's recommendation to return to the airport. With no thrust forces from the turbines and with 155 passengers on board, assessing the situation of the instruments, he decides to land in the Hudson River. Everyone was saved and no one was hurt, but Sully went through a lot of trials before the courts, until he pointed out the "human factor".

The business environment of the digital age is turbulent, unpredictable, and accelerating at a pace never seen before. Established organizations find themselves constantly challenged by small, agile competitors who can transform ideas into market-ready solutions in weeks, not years. To thrive under such conditions, organizations must master three fundamental challenges:
1. Solve internal problems quickly and effectively, ensuring that products and services remain reliable and of high quality.
2. Expand performance faster than competitors, maintaining relevance and leadership in markets where barriers to entry are collapsing.
3. Optimize internal processes continuously, so that inefficiencies do not erode profitability in the future.

Traditionally, many leaders relied on experience, intuition, and gut feeling to make these decisions. While experience remains invaluable, relying solely on it in today’s environment is equivalent to trying to land an airplane during a storm, at night, with no visibility and no instruments. Even the most skilled pilot cannot safely guide the aircraft without access to altitude, speed, navigation, and weather data. At best, the landing would be a lucky strike — but luck is not a strategy.

The same is true in business. Strategic and operational decisions today are too critical to be left to instinct alone. Organizations that continue to operate this way risk making blind landings every day — hoping for the best while exposing themselves, their customers, and their shareholders to unnecessary dangers.

The antidote is clear: a disciplined culture of data-driven decision-making. Digital organizations embed data generation and usage into every aspect of their operations, from customer interactions and internal processes to market and environmental signals. But more than simply collecting data, they ensure it is consistent, reliable, and accessible. This is what we call a Single Source of Truth (SSOT).

Without an SSOT, organizations fall into the trap of conflicting reports, duplicated metrics, and fragmented systems. One team sees one version of performance, while another interprets something different. Decisions become delayed, debates shift to which numbers are “right,” and opportunities are lost. With an SSOT, however, leaders gain the confidence to act quickly, knowing their instruments are aligned and calibrated.

Beyond reporting, the frontier of data-driven decision-making lies in AI and advanced analytics. Just as modern aircraft rely on autopilot systems, predictive models, and automated alerts to reduce risk, organizations can harness Machine Learning, real-time analytics, and simulation models to anticipate risks, detect anomalies, and recommend actions before problems escalate. For example:
* Predictive maintenance can forecast failures in manufacturing equipment, avoiding costly downtime.
* Fraud detection algorithms can surface anomalies in real-time transactions, protecting customers before fraud occurs.
* AI-driven customer analytics can recommend next-best actions, improving satisfaction and loyalty.

All of this, however, requires a mature data strategy. Elevating data maturity means moving from:
* Data in silos → to integrated data lakes and warehouses.
* Manual reporting → to real-time dashboards and alerts.
* Descriptive analytics (what happened) → to predictive and prescriptive analytics (what will happen and what to do about it).

When these capabilities are in place, decision-making transforms. Leaders no longer rely on chance or “flying blind.” Instead, they operate with the equivalent of a cockpit full of instruments: telemetry, radar, and autopilot systems that not only illuminate the present but also anticipate the future.

Ultimately, the metaphor holds: landing without visibility and instruments is a gamble no pilot would accept. Likewise, in today’s digital economy, running a business without reliable data is reckless. By cultivating a single source of truth, embedding AI into decision-making, and building organizational trust in data, companies can ensure their journeys are smoother, their decisions sharper, and their landings always safe.
