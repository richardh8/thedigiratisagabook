# Postponing, getting deeper into the crisis

>"When the fog of routine thickens, lift your head above it. See the horizon before the tide of complacency pulls you under. The status quo is a silent undertow—subtle, comfortable, and deadly to vision. If you allow operational noise to drown out strategic clarity, you will drift—not by a single catastrophic wave, but by countless small currents—until you no longer recognize where you are, nor where you were meant to go."

In Joker, Arthur Fleck spirals into a chaotic descent, not simply because of mental illness, but because society stopped listening, caring, or changing. Each postponed decision, each ignored signal, pushed him further into a world where madness made more sense than logic. Organizations, too, postpone — they drown in denial, silencing the signals of entropy, indulging in status quo comfort until the culture fractures from within. Just like Arthur, they don’t explode all at once — they unravel.

This image is not about villainy. It’s about what happens when leaders fail to act, when systems lose their soul, and when the cracks are painted over until collapse becomes inevitable.
And then… we wonder how we got here.|

Organizations and businesses are vulnerable to indulgence at many stages of their evolution, just as the people within them can grow oblivious to the very reasons their culture, processes, tools, and technologies were established in the first place. This indulgence is not born out of a lack of care for the value proposition or customers, but from a slow erosion of awareness over time.

In the early stages of an organization’s life, its foundations are clear: a purpose, a reason, and a problem to solve. But as time passes, entropy sets in. Layers of agendas accumulate, often drifting far from the roots of the original mission. The purpose that once energized people and gave meaning to their roles fades into the background. For many employees, the reason they joined—the “why” of their contribution—simply no longer exists in their day-to-day reality.

This is when indulgence takes hold. The organization, to some degree, becomes autonomous—self-sustaining in structure but disconnected in spirit. People become increasingly specialized, executives devise ever more intricate strategies, and silos grow taller. The sense of connection, belonging, and ownership diminishes.

It’s much like the experience of driving for many years: we grow confident enough to multitask behind the wheel, forgetting the importance of full attention to the road ahead. And then—when we least expect it—comes the sudden crash: a parking scrape, a hard brake, or something worse.

Modern organizations face their own set of distractions that steer people away from core purpose, values, and principles. Career agendas, personal ambitions, sales mishaps, office politics, self-serving boards of investors, misguided bonus schemes, weak human resources policies, and finally disengaged leadership. In a spiral, comes the tactical, and desperate short-term decisions that shortcut strategy, mission, goals all together. All of these slowly drain energy and interest from the work that matters most. And the most dangerous outcome of all? Slipping into mediocrity.

This is the point where organizations either lose great talent—or, worse, retain bad talent, because those people are usually oblivious of the vision. It is a natural tendency in many mature, successful organizations to rest on their laurels, to believe past victories will carry them forward. But the universal truth is this: everything is dynamic, everything is relative, and change is constant. No one gets a break—nor the organization, nor its people. Both internal and external realities are shifting. What worked before will almost certainly fail tomorrow.

If there is still clarity about what’s going wrong and an acknowledgment that change is needed, the next stage—after overcoming denial—is the debate on how to regain strength and rebuild the future through true engagement. But often, executives have already disengaged, no longer seeing themselves in the medium- or long-term future of the organization.

The longer the delay, the deeper the decline. Without bold, risk-taking action, the pattern repeats: more of the same, doing more with less, cutting costs, and making empty promises that never last. In many cases, it ends with the CEO stepping down—a decision driven by fear—casting a dark cloud over the organization’s culture. And from there, three paths emerge:

* Some people leave outright.
* Some stay, hoping to see where things lead.
* And some remain, suffering silently, surrounded by many yet profoundly alone.
