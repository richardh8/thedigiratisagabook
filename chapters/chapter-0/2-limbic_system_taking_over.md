# Limbic system taking over

>"In the wild, freezing might keep you alive for a moment—but in the arena of digital transformation, it will bury you. Flight is not an option when disruption is seconds away. When the fight begins, the smallest window of decision is your quantum advantage: a fleeting span to reclaim control of space and time, to adapt, learn, and evolve before the next wave hits."

>“Fight. Adapt. Survive. Remember. Evolve.”
When Jason Bourne wakes up, he doesn’t know who he is—but his survival instinct knows everything. In a world of chaos, he learns to see patterns, reclaim agency, and act fast. In digital transformation, you’re Bourne at the edge: no time to freeze, no room for panic. The ones who evolve in motion—who choose to fight and learn in real-time—are the ones who survive disruption and rewrite their future.|

CEOs, founders, and executives are, without question, human—complete with their strengths, flaws, and failings. Yet, they occupy the highest ranks because of their experiences, seniority, and track records. For the organizations they lead, this means they are relied upon, often completely, to confront whatever arises—turning problems into challenges, and challenges into opportunities. But here lies the uncomfortable truth: how many opportunities are abandoned, sacrificed to fear or shame?

The market loves to praise leadership qualities and celebrate success stories in news headlines and on social media. And yet, many leaders lean too heavily on past achievements, treating them like a recipe for repeatable success. They rely on arguments grounded in logic and precedent, while the executive board and shareholders, focused on protecting financial interests, rarely push back. Shareholders want reduced risk. Executives want to protect their positions, salaries, bonuses, and equity.

In this setting, the most important stakeholder—the organization as a whole—is underrepresented. The management teams, the employees in every area who keep the business running, are rarely given their rightful role in facing challenges head-on. Why, then, would any leader willingly weaken their capabilities and throughput?

Business is a race of many rounds. Strategy, guided by clear purposes, principles and anchored in values, is essential—not just for winning the next lap, but for sustaining momentum over the long haul. Organizations that succeed only when the economy is strong have not yet faced true pain. They have not been tested deeply enough to discover their character and principles in action. Until then, corporate values remain empty slogans on office walls—lonely, decorative artifacts often contained within a rebranded “People Department” (the modern facelift of HR), sprinkled with trendy perks curated by CEOs and founders.

The moment trouble arrives, those principles vanish like ghosts from the past. Leaders default to “logical” actions, operating from a narrow, operational mindset. Everything becomes a dollar figure wrapped in colorful charts. Layoffs are treated as a logical inevitability—justified on the grounds of financial prudence or readiness for the challenges ahead—when, in reality, they often signal the most severe leadership failure of all.
Mass layoffs, in particular, are proof that the executive team misjudged badly. It’s like piling your buffet plate too high, only to leave half of it uneaten: wasteful, shortsighted, and irresponsible. Except here, we are not talking about wasted food. We are talking about people. The damage is far deeper and longer-lasting.

These decisions are often driven by the limbic system’s instinctive survival mode—urgent, fear-driven reactions that bypass the rational, strategic thinking of the frontal cortex. Courage means resisting that reflex, reframing the crisis as an opportunity, and daring to make decisions that strengthen the organization’s future returns for all stakeholders.

Retreating into silence and hiding until conditions feel safe again is the hallmark of a company that is not a true challenger to the status quo. It’s an admission of defeat before the real battle has even begun. By doing so, leaders miss the opportunity to:

* Build and reinforce trust in their leadership.
* Boost morale during adversity.
* Mobilize their most valuable resources—the people—for a renewed purpose.
* Give the organization the chance to overcome the challenge and emerge stronger.

The greatest lessons in principles, values, and organizational character are forged in real-world crises. A world that gives you the chance to prove yourself is * offering you the stage to exceed your own limits—both in what you can control and in what you cannot.

Layoffs are only one form of headwind. Others will emerge from the “uncontrolled quadrant”—events and forces entirely outside your influence. And that is why leaders must fight, persist, and remain open. Ask for help. Be vulnerable. Accept that it’s okay to feel like an impostor or to admit weakness. When framed with the right mindset, these moments can unlock the full power of collective trust.

Organizations navigating digital transformation under these conditions have the potential to seize and execute on the most challenging—and most rewarding—opportunities of their existence.
