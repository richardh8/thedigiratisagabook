## Why the Saga Works

Unlike methodologies that compartmentalize or isolate activities, the Saga works because it:
* Combines strategy and tactics: Purpose, vision, and future-looking scenarios flow seamlessly into execution roadmaps and commitments.
* Uses storytelling as glue: Participants don’t just complete exercises; they create and live a narrative that is memorable and shareable.
* Is inclusive and anarchical: Every voice matters equally—executives, frontline staff, technologists, and creatives. Hierarchy dissolves, and energy drives participation.
* Is simple yet dynamic: Rules are clear but flexible, creating just enough structure to channel creativity without stifling it.
* Produces concrete outcomes: Beyond inspiration, the Saga ends with actionable roadmaps, agreed priorities, and committed ownership.

As depicted in the “Creating a Story” model, the Digirati Saga ensures participants are both writing a story and living it at the same time. Every chapter they co-create becomes part of a collective book—a transformation narrative that is theirs to own, share, and carry forward. In the end, the Saga is not just about transforming organizations. It is about transforming people, who in turn carry the transformation into their teams, their customers, and their ecosystems.

It is the story of digital transformation told not by consultants or executives, but by the very people who will live it.
