# The Problem is Yours

>"Many organizations still cling to the magical thinking that customers can be retained primarily by “enchanting” them — showering them with perks, theatrics, and the occasional surprise-and-delight moment. It’s no coincidence that Disney’s legendary service model is cited endlessly in team meetings about customer experience. While there is value in inspiration from such cases, this “delight-first” mindset can easily become a distraction from what matters most: efficiently solving the customer’s problems and, before that, solving the organization’s own problems that create friction in the first place."

|Don't insult your customer, make them your ally|

>In the movie *Up in the Air*, Ryan Bingham travels the country firing people on behalf of corporate employers. For him, the job is efficient, transactional — until Natalie, a tech-savvy colleague, proposes automating the process via video conferencing. This forces Ryan to confront the emotional distance in his work. Gradually, he begins to see the people he fires not as tasks, but as *humans* navigating trauma. The lesson? Efficiency without empathy alienates. Real service is not about performance — it’s about *ownership*. The problem isn’t the customer’s. It’s yours — fix it.

Ask yourself: how many customers leave because of unresolved service issues compared to those who stay out of sheer delight? The answer is stark — far more customers walk away due to frustration than remain loyal because of a momentary “wow” experience. Research by the Customer Contact Council involving more than 75,000 participants confirms it: delighting the customer does not guarantee loyalty. What actually drives retention is reducing the customer’s effort to resolve an issue.
In other words, before rushing to exceed expectations, ensure that you consistently meet expectations — reliably, predictably, and without unnecessary complications. Customers value a company’s posture, commitment, and competence in fulfilling its value proposition more than any short-lived “special effect” that fades quickly after the campaign ends.

**Understanding the Real Job to Be Done**

The real work begins with a deep understanding of the customer journey — mapping each step they take when trying to solve a problem and identifying every obstacle along the way. Digital tools now make this easier than ever, offering insights into customer behavior and enabling prediction of actions. By leveraging these tools, companies can:
* Pinpoint friction points in processes and eliminate them before they escalate.
* Anticipate needs and resolve potential problems before the customer notices them.
* Offer proactive, context-aware solutions that create lasting trust.

**Principles for Owning the Problem**

**1. Don’t transfer blame to your customers**

While some problems are influenced by customer behavior, the company must own the resolution. Too often, organizations design inside-out processes — built to fix internal inefficiencies but at the expense of customer ease. This results in customers feeling at fault for failures they did not cause. True customer-centricity starts with seeing every obstacle as yours to remove.

**2. Solve the present — and prevent the future**

Reactive service is not enough. Prevention demands continuous learning, rigorous data analysis, and predictive capabilities. Digital transformation amplifies this capacity, allowing organizations to design solutions for problems customers didn’t even know they had yet.

**3. When you fail, own it with sincerity**

Failure handled well can actually increase loyalty. The key is to respond quickly, take responsibility without defensiveness, and convey genuine care. A heartfelt apology, backed by concrete action, can turn a negative into a trust-building moment.

**4. Keep communication channels open and authentic**

Your customers are an ongoing source of insight — free consultants who interact with your products or services daily. Structured feedback loops, easy contact channels, and transparent responses foster a partnership for continuous improvement.

**5. Never assume a complaint is an attack**

A customer who contacts you is, in most cases, giving you a chance to fix the relationship. Treat them as a partner, not a nuisance. Some fixes may require investment, but many of the failures that cause the highest dissatisfaction are solvable through small technical adjustments or minor policy changes.

**Leadership and Empowerment at the Front Line**
True ownership of customer problems is a leadership responsibility, but resolution authority must be delegated to the front line. The people who interact directly with customers should be empowered — and trained — to act decisively, without bureaucratic delays. This requires:
* Leaders who model commitment to customer satisfaction.
* Clear guidelines and boundaries for decision-making autonomy.
* Recognition systems that reward proactive problem-solving.

⸻

**Bottom line:**

Before you focus on delight, focus on delivering. Consistently meeting expectations and removing friction creates the foundation for loyalty. Once this is in place, “enchantment” can enhance an already solid relationship — but without it, the most spectacular magic trick will only distract from the cracks in your service.
