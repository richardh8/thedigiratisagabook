# What Was Really Your Problem?

>“In today’s world, technology and business strategy are inseparable — they must be conceived, discussed, and executed together. Technology is not an accessory to strategy; it is a core driver of problem-solving, innovation, and business improvement. To unlock its full potential, organizations must avoid outdated practices such as treating other functions as ‘internal customers,’ assuming non-technical teams lack technological insight, or spreading professionals thin across multiple initiatives. Instead, technology leaders should work side by side with business stakeholders, co-creating solutions, sharing ownership of outcomes, and aligning every technological choice with the organization’s strategic goals.”

|Technology without strategy? Strategy without technology?|

>In the series *Lost*, 72 plane crash survivors find themselves stranded on a mysterious island, surrounded by uncertainty, tension, and hidden threats. With no map, no alignment, and no clear plan, each group improvises — often at odds with one another. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear: survival isn't about strength, it's about coordination. The island becomes a metaphor for what happens when strategy and execution are misaligned — when people operate in silos, without shared purpose or direction. In business, like in *Lost*, disconnection leads to chaos. Co-creating strategy and technology as one is the only way out.

In the not-so-distant past, technology adoption inside organizations often happened in two completely separate acts. The first act took place in the boardroom, where executives from business units — focused entirely on boosting revenue, cutting costs, or reducing risk — would define strategy with almost no mention of technology. The second act came later, when the technology specialists were invited in to “support” that strategy, usually with a narrow brief: “Help us implement what we’ve already decided.”

The narrative was clear and consistent: “Technology helps us realize our brilliant strategies.”

That model worked — until it didn’t. As technology began to evolve faster than corporate planning cycles, and as market-disrupting companies emerged seemingly overnight, the organizations that clung to this old split lost market share, relevance, and in many cases, their very existence. The companies that survived, and thrived, were those that treated technology not as an afterthought, but as an integral part of defining the strategy itself.

Today, technology and business are inseparable threads of the same fabric. Discussing them at different times, in different rooms, with different decision-makers, is a guaranteed path to mediocrity or failure. The modern expectation is the reverse of the old thinking: “Technology has helped us define brilliant strategies.”

This shift has real implications for how organizations work. Selecting, adopting, and integrating technology should be embedded in the company’s DNA, present in conversations at every level and every function — from product ideation to marketing, from finance to operations. When someone asks, “What was your problem?”, the answer must be built collaboratively, bringing together business leaders, domain experts, technologists, and even customers. In an era where disruption is the norm, technology is often not just the enabler but the protagonist of the transformation.
Unfortunately, many organizations still hold on to outdated practices that sabotage this integration:

**1. Treating other functions as “internal customers” of IT.**

Traditional IT structures — with rigid Service Level Agreements (SLAs), chargeback models, and project ticketing systems — create artificial walls inside the company. This model turns business units into “clients” of IT instead of collaborators. The result? Technology becomes reactive, serving only pre-defined requests instead of co-creating disruptive solutions. In today’s fast-paced market, that approach slows innovation to a crawl.

**2. Assuming non-technical professionals are “technologically illiterate.”**
This is a dangerous and outdated bias. Most professionals in marketing, finance, product, and operations are now heavy users of technology in both their personal and professional lives. Many are deeply familiar with tools, analytics platforms, automation systems, and even coding basics. Treating them as passive consumers of tech wastes their insight. Instead, they should be active contributors to solution design.

**3. Spreading people thin across multiple initiatives.**
The myth of the “multitasker” dies hard, but the reality is clear: humans are far more productive and creative when focused. Assigning people to multiple unrelated projects at once dilutes attention, slows problem-solving, and results in half-finished work. For technology-led initiatives, the cost of context-switching can be huge — missed deadlines, poorly integrated solutions, and a fragmented user experience.

**4. Limiting IT’s role to “Yes” or “No” answers.**

In isolated IT departments, requests often boil down to resource availability: “Yes, we can take this on” or “No, we don’t have capacity.” That’s the wrong conversation. The right approach is: “This can be done, and here’s how we can make it work together.” Technology functions should be embedded in business discussions from the start, shaping the what and why, not just the how.

**Moving to a Collaborative, Technology-First Culture**

In a mature digital organization, technology teams and business teams work as one. Instead of requirements being “thrown over the wall,” solution design is co-created in real time. For example:
* A product manager brings customer pain points and desired outcomes.
* A data scientist contributes predictive insights from behavioral analytics.
* A systems architect maps the technical landscape and identifies reusable API services.
* A security lead ensures privacy and compliance from the first discussion.

This kind of cross-functional integration doesn’t just improve the speed of delivery — it increases the likelihood of building the right thing the first time. It allows the team to ask not only “How can we solve this?” but also “Is this the right problem to solve?” and “Can technology help us solve it in a better, faster, or more scalable way than our competitors?”

**Technical Considerations for a Technology-Business Fusion**

To truly fuse technology and business strategy, companies must also pay attention to the infrastructure and process layers:
* Unified platforms that allow multiple teams to work in the same environment (e.g., shared analytics dashboards, common API gateways).
* Low-code and no-code tools that enable non-technical teams to prototype solutions without waiting on IT backlogs.
* Cloud-native architectures that support rapid scaling and deployment across markets.
* Continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to shorten release cycles and allow rapid experimentation.
* Data governance frameworks that ensure all decisions are made with clean, trusted data.

These aren’t just IT best practices — they’re strategic enablers. They turn technology from a cost center into a growth engine.

If you get this right, the old “two-step” process of strategy first, technology later becomes a relic. Instead, strategy and technology emerge together, inseparably, from the same conversations. And when you’re asked, “What was your problem?”, your answer won’t just describe a challenge — it will describe a vision for how technology helped shape the solution, define the opportunity, and create a competitive advantage your rivals will struggle to match.
