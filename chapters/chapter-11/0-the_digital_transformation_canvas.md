Your digital transformation—planned by truly engaged people—on a single page
At digifly.me, we understand that digital transformation within an organization is not achieved merely by delivering new technologies, but through a series of actions, changes, and values, while effectively involving people—through empowerment and a new approach to engagement. In other words, we believe the challenges span from cultural, organizational, and leadership aspects all the way to the most technical levels of planning, development, and business operations. This is why we’ve implemented our formula for digital transformation.
The Digital Transformation Canvas (DTC) is the catalyst for your team’s potential—guided and planned through the Digirati Journey, and supported by the Digital Hive, which contains a collection of trends, best practices, experiences, challenges, and methods to effectively deliver digital transformation within your organization. It complements most canvases available on the market in terms of planning and delivering the digital transformation journey. Its objective is to bring together leadership, talent, and partners within your organization in an engaging and collaborative way—promoting alignment and delivering concrete and realistic digital skills and capabilities.
The digital agenda—and its countless jargon-filled subcomponents—such as Social Media, AI, IoT, Cloud, Analytics, Mobile, Cybersecurity, Blockchain, and Machine Learning; current practices like Agile Methods, Lean Management, Product Strategy, and Digital Marketing; as well as players from the ecosystem such as Startups, Fintechs, and eCommerce companies, to name just a few—become overwhelming for any organization to absorb, learn, digest, ideate, and determine how to leverage… and, worse yet, how to deliver.
With over 25 years of experience in digital fields—across both business and technology—in large, complex, global, and local organizations that have deployed technology solutions since the advent of the internet, we have gathered lessons we deeply value. From many failures to many success stories, this journey has resulted in a significant collection of practices, mindsets, and attitudes of great value—now distilled into a guiding tool we present here: the Digital Hive and the Digirati Journey, which together create a “laboratory environment” for the best collaboration among your talents. We put customers, employees, and partners at the center of these activities—working together collaboratively—so they are recognized, valued, understood, and engaged, rather than being treated as predictable, emotionless resources within a culture, purpose, and processes that restrict them and limit their ability to reach their greatest potential: teamwork.
This is why we created the DTC—not only to inspire ourselves but also to inspire others like us—to focus on achieving and sustaining an effective and continuous digital transformation, enabling organizations to thrive and survive not just through the end of this decade, but into the next and beyond.
We dedicate this work to all digital leaders—of all types, profiles, and at different levels within their organizations—who feel somewhat lonely, isolated, or misunderstood in their efforts to digitally transform their organizations and culture.
Motivational Facts
List here all motivations, concerns, interests, and opportunities that are guiding the organization in its pursuit of improvement, change, and transformation. Determine why the organization is taking this step forward in discussions with its employees and customers in the quest for change.
Innovative Results
Add all ideas, suggestions, and solutions that emerged during the session and show potential to be innovative—those that could be valuable for the transformation program or the expected products and services. Also define what and how these innovation processes will be introduced.
Idea Basket
Include ideas that do not seem to fit neatly into the domains. Every idea is valuable, and after the session ends, these ideas should be reviewed and discussed.
Restrictions Parking Lot
List all issues, blocks, and concerns that arise during the session—record them only, without trying to discuss or address them during the idea generation process. These constraints will be considered at the end of the session, and proposals to overcome them should be discussed.

People
Assess the current state of culture, organization, and communication, and establish a vision that defines which people fit into this ambition. Include ideas on how to foster empowerment, collaboration, and productivity, considering different organizational approaches and methodologies. Define how to communicate effectively through internal channels—keeping it simple and to the point—what skills are required, which policies will be implemented to motivate, engage, and recognize people, and the clear objectives these people should focus on.
Value
Determine what values will be created for employees and customers that will legitimize their engagement and interest from emotional, ethical, societal, and financial perspectives. Reflect on whether the vision, mission, and strategies are aligned with the proposed values. Also define how these values will be introduced to the teams and to the market—from a human perspective as well as through the various interaction channels employees and customers will use. Add ideas for the organization’s brand and how to meet the expected values to be delivered.
Business
Add here how the business will be transformed, changed, or improved. Which strategies, programs, and projects will support implementation and post-implementation. Define the steps, sequence, and priority of these changes, as well as the budget for these changes. Include estimates for the change and how this investment will pay off. Define the strategies to be applied to keep operations running and how the change will be carried forward. Also detail how the change will be delivered throughout the transformation cycle.
Partners
Assess and list the current partners your organization has, and identify potential partners such as IT providers, startups, investors, hackathons, consultants, and others you believe will help drive innovation and break the status quo, while adding new value, skills, and capabilities to the process and outcomes of the digital transformation initiative. Also consider the execution qualities that partners must have in order to support and sustain the transformation throughout the journey.
User Experience
Define the approach that will engage customers in a co-creative way through empathy and addressing their main problems. Add ideas on how the organization will adjust its mindset and practices to place customers at the center of everything—communicating, documenting, interacting, producing, supporting, and more. Define how the organization will shift its perspective to design solutions from an experience point of view across all touchpoints, how it will measure interactions, and—most importantly—how customer data will become a core value to guide improvements and changes in the transformation program.
Technology
List the technologies, solutions, and platforms that will drive and enable people, values, business, partners, and the end-user experience across all interactions within the other five angles of the canvas. Learn and update your understanding of current market technology trends, as well as practices and methods employees believe work, and how all of this will support a frequent, time-bound continuous delivery model. Build, Execute, Launch, and Repeat your technological capabilities in an automated way.
Include the characteristics of employees and customers currently involved in the organization, as well as new characteristics and types of employees and customers who need to join this transformation.
And what is the Digital Transformation Roadmap?
