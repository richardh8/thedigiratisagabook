# Watch out for the sharks

>“Influence is power—but power without alignment is a risk. In the digital age, partnerships with influencers, brands, providers and external voices can amplify your brand or sink it. Choosing wisely means looking beyond image and reach, into values, governance, and truthfulness. Transparency, cultural alignment, and shared accountability are the only real safeguards against reputational harm.”

>In the movie "Jaws", Martin Brody is the chief of police on Amity Island, who investigates the death of beachgoers in the area. The city's mayor didn't want tourists to know what was actually happening. Martin sought to close the beaches to bathers, but the mayor was deceiving the population. Together with their partners Matt Hopper, an oceanographer and Quint a shark hunter, they finally find the cause of death.

They arrived first as a trend, then conquered brands, won over consumers, attracted mainstream media attention, and ultimately established themselves as a dominant force in modern communication. We are talking about the influencers.

Today, digital influencers are woven into the marketing strategies of nearly every company that seeks visibility and resonance in digital environments. Platforms like Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, X (Twitter), Snapchat, and Twitch have transformed influencers into powerful distribution channels capable of shaping consumer perception and driving purchasing decisions. For many brands, partnering with influencers is no longer optional; it is a core pillar of how they communicate, attract audiences, and establish relevance.

Yet, amid this rise, one question looms: are companies truly aware of the partnerships they are forming? The same power that can elevate a brand can also quickly damage it. Choosing the wrong influencer—or failing to manage the partnership correctly—can turn visibility into vulnerability.

In today’s decentralized media environment, where authorship is fragmented and fake news spreads like wildfire, the risks are magnified. Followers often take influencer content at face value, without verifying sources or questioning accuracy. If an influencer associated with your brand becomes entangled in misinformation, unethical behavior, or misalignment with your values, the reputational backlash is swift and severe. The influencer’s voice becomes your voice, for better or worse.

Therefore, partnerships in the context of digital transformation must go beyond surface-level attraction—number of followers, visual appeal, or commercial hype. Companies must evaluate whether partners demonstrate the characteristics of a real digital organization: sound governance, transparent management, ethical practices, and alignment with the organization’s mission and values.

Here are some guiding principles for avoiding “sharks” in the partnership ecosystem:
* Value consultants and startups: Smaller players often offer deeper expertise, higher levels of dedication, and closer cultural fit than overexposed influencers chasing commercial contracts.
* Assess customer references: Speak to existing clients or users of a potential partner or influencer to understand their real impact, not just their marketing image.
* Look beyond transactions: Is the relationship built on co-creation, shared purpose, and measurable impact, or is it purely a financial exchange? Many suppliers and influencers sell proposals without the necessary skills, authenticity, or intent to deliver real value.
* Evaluate risk-sharing: Does the partner have “skin in the game”? Are they equally accountable for outcomes, or do contracts allow them to escape responsibility when results fall short?

Leaders navigating this ecosystem must embrace a culture of truthfulness and transparency. Quick, fact-based responses to messaging issues are essential to protect brand equity. Encouraging honesty, logical reasoning, and evidence-based decision-making across the organization helps reduce reputational risk and strengthens resilience when inevitable challenges arise.

Partnerships should not be about outsourcing trust; they should be about sharing it. A genuine alliance with an influencer or digital partner is built on vulnerability, accountability, and mutual commitment. The best partners are those who amplify not just your message but your values, reinforcing credibility and long-term consumer loyalty.

In this sense, managing influencer partnerships is not just a marketing tactic—it is part of the broader responsibility of digital governance. It requires vigilance, discernment, and managerial skills that combine critical thinking, ethical judgment, and brand stewardship.

Ultimately, companies that balance the power of digital influence with transparency, cultural alignment, and risk management will thrive in the era of hyper-visibility. Those who don’t may learn the hard way: in a sea full of opportunities, there are always sharks.
