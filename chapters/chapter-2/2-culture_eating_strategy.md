# Culture Eating Strategy

>"Strategy may set the direction, but culture determines whether you’ll get there. In digital transformation, aligning both is not optional—it’s the only way to gain trust, inspire loyalty, and carry your organization through uncertainty and change."

|Organizational culture is your strategy|

>In the movie *The Wolf of Wall Street*, Jordan Belfort drives Stratton Oakmont with a bold, unorthodox culture—fueled by charisma, rewards, and shared rituals. While the company’s strategy was aggressive growth, it was the *culture* that mobilized people with intensity, loyalty, and belief in a collective cause (however flawed). For better or worse, the firm didn’t run on structure—it ran on energy. The story is a sharp reminder that culture can drive performance faster than strategy alone… or derail it completely.

Understanding organizational culture is not a side exercise—it’s a strategic necessity for lasting business success. A single, deceptively simple question can open the door to this understanding:

“How do you feel working here?”

The answers reveal far more than operational metrics ever could. They tell you whether people feel connected to the organization’s purpose, whether they see themselves in its story, and whether they believe in its future.

Organizational culture is the living embodiment of an organization’s meanings and purposes. It’s not written solely in handbooks or corporate statements—it is defined and redefined every day by the attitudes, choices, and shared experiences of the people who make up the organization.

When an organization launches a new strategy, its success is directly proportional to the degree of alignment between that strategy and the existing organizational values and culture. If the two are in harmony, execution feels natural—momentum builds almost effortlessly. But if a strategy stands in opposition to the prevailing culture, people often perceive it as a betrayal. This breach of trust can poison morale, slow execution, and in some cases, completely sabotage the intended results.

Digital transformation is perhaps the ultimate culture–strategy stress test. By its nature, it seeks to reshape fundamental aspects of the organization:
* How internal processes operate
* How employees think and behave
* How products and services are designed and delivered
* Sometimes, the very business model itself

This level of change can only succeed when it resonates with the culture—or when culture is deliberately and thoughtfully evolved to embrace the transformation. Without this alignment, transformation risks being rejected like a foreign object in the body’s immune system.

When digital transformation is embedded within the cultural DNA, acceptance flows naturally:
* Employees embrace change without constant top-down direction.
* Customers and suppliers sense the authenticity of the shift.
* External stakeholders see consistency between words and actions.

In these moments, culture acts as both the engine and the safety net—driving adoption and protecting the organization in turbulent times.

The value of aligning culture with strategy is clear:
* Resilience in crisis – People anchored in the culture stand with the organization through hardship, even before recovery plans are in place.
* Defensive loyalty – In moments of reputational challenge, employees become advocates, not detractors.
* Purpose over policy – People remain loyal to the culture’s meanings and values, not just to the current strategy.
* Confidence through coherence – Strategies that reflect cultural values are viewed as authentic, instilling trust and commitment.

In short, culture eats strategy for breakfast not because strategy is irrelevant, but because culture is what allows strategy to live beyond the planning stage. In the context of digital transformation—where change is rapid, complex, and often uncomfortable—culture alignment is not merely a competitive advantage. It is the difference between transformation that thrives and transformation that fails.
