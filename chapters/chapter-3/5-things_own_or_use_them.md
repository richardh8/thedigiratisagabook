# Things — Own or Use Them?

>"Ownership once defined status and power. Today, in a connected and collaborative world, the real power lies not in what we own, but in what we can access, share, and co-create. The currency of influence is no longer possession — it’s participation."

>In the movie *Brewster's Millions*, Monty Brewster inherits a strange challenge: spend $30 million in 30 days without accumulating assets, destroying value, or explaining why. To win the full $300 million inheritance, he must rethink the very concept of wealth. His strategy? Rent, lease, circulate—*never own*. He invests in experiences, services, and influence rather than things. This reversal of traditional value shows us a profound truth: in the modern world, power isn’t in owning — it’s in flowing, sharing, and creating value through **access over assets**.

For millennia, the accumulation of goods was synonymous with influence, security, and power. Whoever controlled more land, livestock, factories, or machinery could produce more, control more, and dictate the pace of markets. Wealth was measured in tangible assets, and the more you had, the more power you wielded.

But this equation has changed. Over the past century, the mass production of goods, globalized supply chains, and technological advancement have drastically reduced the cost of ownership. Cars, appliances, high-end electronics, and even forms of digital inclusion are now within reach of billions, not just the privileged few. This democratization of access has eroded the old prestige of “having more.”

Today, we live in a world where power is no longer defined by accumulation. The rise of the sharing economy — powered by platforms like Uber, Lyft, and Airbnb — has transformed the meaning of value. People are increasingly shifting from the mindset of owning to the mindset of using. Digital platforms now act as connectors between supply and demand, enabling individuals to access what they need without the burden of ownership, and to monetize underutilized assets they already have.

This shift is not just economic; it is cultural. Generations born after 1990 — particularly Millennials and Gen Z — are less interested in collecting things and more focused on experiences, mobility, and flexibility. Minimalism has become a lifestyle choice, not a constraint. Bookshelves, CD racks, and DVD collections have been replaced by cloud libraries, streaming platforms, and all-in-one smartphones. What once occupied physical space now exists as infinite, on-demand digital access.

Interestingly, we’ve also moved past the idea that information itself is power. In the early internet age, having exclusive knowledge was a strategic advantage. But with smartphones putting 98% of humanity’s recorded knowledge into everyone’s pocket, information is no longer scarce — and therefore no longer the differentiator it once was. True power now comes from what you do with information, not merely having it.

In organizations, this shift is equally profound. The old model required companies to own everything necessary for operations: equipment, infrastructure, even in-house teams for every function. Today, organizations are realizing they can focus on their core capabilities — the knowledge, expertise, and intellectual property that truly differentiate them — and share or outsource everything else. This can mean coworking spaces instead of owned office buildings, cloud computing instead of data centers, or “pay-as-you-go” partnerships instead of permanent infrastructure investments.

The sharing economy, sometimes called the collaborative economy, is expanding into every niche imaginable. It thrives because it aligns perfectly with the digital age: scalability, low barriers to entry, and the ability to reach global audiences instantly. Without the reach and efficiency of digital platforms, many of these business models would be impossible.

For some organizations, embracing sharing has meant exponential growth and new market dominance. For others, clinging to the old ownership paradigm has led to decline and irrelevance. History is already showing us examples of once-mighty companies brought down by their inability to adapt to the expectations of new generations — expectations rooted in access, experience, and fluidity, not possession.

So, back to the fundamental question: Where’s the power now?

It resides with people — individuals and communities who, connected through technology, can mobilize resources, ideas, and capabilities faster than any single entity can acquire or own them. It resides in the networks we build, the trust we nurture, and the ecosystems we participate in. In short: power today is measured not by the size of what we own, but by the reach of what we can use and share.
