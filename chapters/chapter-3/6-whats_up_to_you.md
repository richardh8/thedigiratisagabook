# What's up to you?

>"When personal purpose aligns with organizational mission, work transcends a paycheck — it becomes a cause worth fighting for. Without that alignment, no strategy, no salary, and no perks can ignite true commitment."

>In the movie “Braveheart”, William Wallace leads the Scottish rebels in the fight against the rule of the English King Edward I. They couldn't stand the abuses of the English army anymore. After winning countless battles, he is betrayed by the Scottish nobles themselves, ending up tortured and executed in the public square.

One of the leading causes of disengagement and dissatisfaction in the workplace, as numerous studies confirm, is a lack of alignment between an individual’s personal purpose and the organization’s purpose. This mismatch erodes motivation, diminishes performance, and in many cases, leads to the quiet but costly drift of talent away from the business.

Yet the responsibility is not solely on the organization. Employees, too, have a duty to seek clarity and alignment. They should ask themselves:
* What is my motivation for being here?
* What problem am I passionate about solving?
* What unique contribution can I bring to this organization?
* How can I positively impact society through my work?

These questions form the foundation for meaningful engagement, helping professionals determine whether their values, aspirations, and personal sense of mission are in harmony with the organization they choose to serve.

We are living in a new era where high-performing organizations are powered by passion and purpose — not merely by profit. The workforce is increasingly conscious of its societal role, seeking employers whose principles and priorities match their own. This shift is especially pronounced in areas such as sustainability, diversity, social responsibility, and ethical governance. Talented individuals now routinely decline offers from companies whose values contradict their own — no matter how attractive the compensation.

Working with purpose is no longer a luxury reserved for the few; it has become a central pursuit in the quest for personal fulfillment. Purpose-driven work transforms a “job” into a mission, turning professionals into committed allies who stand with their organizations in both triumph and adversity. When people believe in the cause, their talents become weapons in service of something greater than themselves.

This, however, requires self-awareness. Individuals must actively seek to understand their talents, strengths, passions, and values. Only then can they navigate towards roles and organizations where their purpose can take root and grow.

For organizations, the lesson is equally clear: rethink motivational strategies. While competitive salaries remain important, they are no longer the dominant magnet for attracting and retaining top talent. Instead, companies must make their purpose explicit, transparent, and authentic. It’s not enough to put a vision statement on a wall — it must be lived, demonstrated, and embedded into daily decisions. When an organization’s stated purpose resonates with people’s own aspirations, engagement follows naturally.

In the context of a digital transformation journey, the stakes are even higher. Transformations often require revisiting — and sometimes redefining — the organization’s values, mission, and long-term objectives. This can trigger a wide spectrum of reactions: excitement and buy-in from those who see the alignment, but also skepticism, fear, or resistance from those who feel the new direction conflicts with their personal or professional ideals.

This is where leadership plays a decisive role. Leaders must assess whether the organization is ready for the journey — not just in terms of technology and processes, but in terms of purpose alignment. They need to understand what drives their people to stay, contribute, and commit. They must identify which talents, skills, and knowledge will be essential for the future, and then build pathways to acquire and strengthen them.

Crucially, this process cannot be driven solely from the executive suite or dictated by external consultants. Successful alignment is co-created with the teams who will live it every day. Without their involvement, leaders risk building strategies in isolation — strategies that may look strong on paper but collapse under the weight of poor engagement and quiet resistance. In the worst cases, misalignment breeds active sabotage, leading to delays, errors, and wasted investments.

When preparing for a transformation — digital or otherwise — organizations must initiate frank, organization-wide conversations. They should openly ask: Does this new path make sense to our people? Does it make sense to society? And equally important: Do our people see themselves in this journey?

At the end of the day, both sides must answer the same fundamental question: What’s up to you? What is the role you want to play in shaping the future? If the answer feels true and shared, the organization gains more than just compliance — it gains wholehearted commitment.
